Simply fill out the fields (all are required) and indicate which class you are signing up for. A card number is required to secure your spot in a class (even if you plan on paying with a check or in cash). After we receive your registration request, someone from the office will call you to finalize payment information. Once that is taken care of, you will then get a confirmation email from the school.\n\nPlacement in each course is done on a first-come, first-serve basis.  A $100.00 deposit is required to reserve your place in the course.  Payment is accepted in the form of a credit or debit card, check, or cash.\n\n## Cancellation Policy  \n\nTo receive a deposit refund, any cancellations must be made in writing, and are not to exceed five (5) days preceding the start of class. Any cancellations made after this period will result in the loss of the $100.00 deposit. If you do not cancel in writing, are a no-show & do not notify the office AND receive a confirmation response, your card will be charged the full amount.\n\nAll tools and materials for classes are supplied by the school. If there is an item that we prefer you purchase for a class, we will let you know in the confirmation email or before class starts. These extra supplies will never be pricey or unaffordable.\n\nPlease be mindful of the start dates. Our office staff is small and although we try our best to send out class reminders, we do not always get a chance to. That being said, you are responsible for knowing when class starts. The office will contact you if a class needs to be canceled and rescheduled.\n\n## Glassblowing & Metal Students  \n\nPlease wear long, 100% cotton pants (jeans are okay) and closed-toed shoes to each course. Also bring a pair of good-fitting UV sunglasses and sports bottle for cold, filter water.\n\nGlassblowing students work as a team throughout each course; the attendance of each person to each class is essential. If a student must miss a scheduled class, GlassWorks requests 24-hour advance notice, as a courtesy to your classmates and faculty. There are no scheduled makeup classes. Any unforeseen re-scheduling coordinated by the school will be an exception.\n\n\nAll classes will be held in our studio, located at:\n\n727 Magazine Street\nNew Orleans, Louisiana 70130","html":"<div class=\"ui big icon success message\">  \n  <i class=\"close icon\"></i>\n  <i class=\"attention circle icon\"></i>\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <div class=\"header\">Please note:</div>\n    <p>This is not a registration form for our Short Courses.

Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said.

For now - it's definitely a word.\n\n> Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too.

Tragically, however, Jon Webb of Loujon Press died in June of 1971, and while a number of the books were made and distributed, the full edition – including the prints and box – was never completed.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/11/miller_insomnia2.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /> <code>Insomnia series #2 of 12</code>  </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/11/miller_insomnia3.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /> <code>Insomnia series #3 of 12</code></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/11/miller_insomnia5.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /> <code>Insomnia series #5 of 12</code></p>","image":"/content/images/2014/11/miller_insomnia5_cover.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":"Henry Miller: \"Insomnia\" watercolor series on exhibition","meta_description":"Watercolor series \"Insomnia,\" painted by canonical American writer Henry Miller, on exhibit at New Orleans Glassworks through January 2014.","author_id":2,"created_at":1413840311318,"created_by":2,"updated_at":1434559591509,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1415998800000,"published_by":2},{"id":74,"uuid":"6a8dfa14-3ce9-4b10-b624-4cff5df5e6be","title":"\"Space-Age\" Champagne Flute Workshop","slug":"space-age-champagne-flute-workshop","markdown":"Join the New Orleans Glassworks & Printmaking Studio for our newest addition to our Seasonal Creations, our hands-on workshop for \"Space-Age\" Jadite Champagne Flutes.

Sculpture&mdash;Beginner\n\n**Session:** Six (6) Weeks  \n**Start Date:** September 15, 2015  \n**Schedule:** Tuesday Evenings, 6&ndash;9pm  \n**Enrollment:** Maximum Six (6) Students  \n\nIntroduce yourself to the fascinating world of glassblowing as you learn to sculpt honey-like, molten glass on the end of a blowpipe! Under the close guidance of two of our master-glassblowers, students will learn to make blown glass and solid sculptures. They will be introduced to a variety of glassblowing techniques from gathering and forming the initial bubble to adding colored powder or frit. Students will also learn the basics of polishing/finishing and cutting their glass pieces in the cold working studio and will ultimately develop the skills needed to advance to intermediate courses through hands-on experience.\n\n_No previous experience necessary!_\n\n_**Important:**_ for each class, please ensure you bring:\n\n- A pair of sunglasses offering strong UV-protection\n- Bottled water (hydration is key!)\n\n## Venetian Glassblowing &amp; Sculpture&mdash;Intermediate to Advanced[^n]\n\n**Session:** Six (6) Weeks  \n**Start Date:** September 17, 2015  \n**Schedule:** Thursday Evenings, 6&ndash;9pm  \n**Enrollment:** Maximum Six (6) Students  \n\nThis course is designed to _**advance the skills**_ of the intermediate and advanced glassblower, with emphasis on teamwork. Under the instruction of two of our master-glassblowers, students learn the art of pulling cane to incorporate multiple design techniques into patterned, blown sculptures and cut-out pickups. As students advance, they will be challenged to design complex color applications and to create more delicate pieces such as Venetian goblets.\n\n_**Important:**_ for each class, please ensure you bring:\n\n- A pair of sunglasses offering strong UV-protection\n- Bottled water (hydration is key!)\n\n## Glass Lampworking &amp; Scientific Torchworking  \n\n**Session:** Four (4) Weeks  \n**Start Date:** September 19, 2015  \n**Schedule:** Saturday Afternoons, 1&ndash;4pm  \n**Enrollment:** Maximum Eight (8) Students  \n\nIn lampworking, also known as torchworking or flameworking, glass is manipulated using heat from a single flame, transforming glass shapes into object used in contemporary life.\n\nThe focus of this course is use of _**borosilicate glass,**_ both solid rod and hollow tubing.
